# banned

<h4>Banned from a site or organization? Account suspended?</h4>

<h4>Why?</h4>

Send PR: Your side. Their side. Or, just lists of sites you were banned from. Which users have been banned from which sites, that perhaps cannot speak for themselves? Frame your content however you want.

Create Issue: Your side. Their side. Status quo or remedy? Frame your content however you want. 

Do not press "Send" if you cannot handle the discussion. Keep your private stuff to yourself. You are responsible for your posts.

Banners will have chance to reply to the banned. See "Status quo or remedy?" at "Create Issue" There is zero expectation of any user being banned here at banned. 

Cite your primary sources. Unless you attribute the idea to yourself. Facts resolve disputes. 

Do not expect claims of "respect" and "disprespect" to resolve issues. Those are emotions, which perpetuate status quo, not remedies. Do not expect what you consider to be "rude" or "offensive" to be true for someone else: if you cannot handle being offended, or direct communication, you will not be saved by mod squad here, kindly go somewhere else right now and forget you ever found this page! 


> Goebbels was in favor of free speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If you’re really in favor of free speech, then you’re in favor of freedom of speech for precisely the views you despise. Otherwise, you’re not in favor of free speech. - Noam Chomsky
